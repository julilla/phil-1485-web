        <p><b>Course Summary.</b>
          Self-quantification is ubiquitous. From smart watches that track biometrics and sleep quality to productivity trackers which tell us how we actually spend our time, modern digital technologies provide us with the tools to observe, measure and collect data about ourselves at great levels of detail. But does this data really help us understand ourselves better? Is the kind of knowledge those technologies offer worth having? Does a quantified self lead to a happier self? In this course, we will explore self-quantification through a range of philosophical perspectives and debates from ethics and political philosophy to epistemology.
