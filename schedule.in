# To generate the calendar: ./schedule.py > schedule.shtml
#
# This file follows a mostly self-documenting format for describing
# calendar data.  Any line that begins with # is a comment.  A line of
# the form "== Name ==" begins a new layer in the calendar.
#
# A line containing a date expression or a hyphen-separated date rate
# moves forward to the next date (or date range) that satisfies that
# expression.  Dates can be given in absolute form as "<Abbreviated
# month> <day>, <year>", in relative form as the name of a weekday, as
# the name of a layer (which represents all dates used by that layer)
# or as a named date definition.  These can be combined with "and",
# "or", "not", and parens in the expected way.  A line of the form
# "NAME = DATE-EXPR" defines a named date definition.

# A line that begins with "- " and any indented lines that follow it
# add items to the current date:
#
# - Holiday[: text]
# - Special[: text]
# - Lec: <text>
# - Rec: <text>
# - Tut: <text>
# - Prep [sections]: <text>
# - Due: <text>
# - Text [CSS class]: <text>
#
# <text> in any of these may be arbitrary HTML text, with the added
# convenience that the form "[href text...]" is converted to a
# hyperlink.
#
# Finally, {{raw}} directly emits raw html, after finishing the
# current calendary week (if there is one).
