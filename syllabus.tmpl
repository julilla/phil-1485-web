<h2>Course Details</h2>

  <li><a href="#grading">Time commitment</a>
  <li><a href="#pol">Policies</a>
</ul>

<h4>Learning objectives</h4>
<a name="desc">

<p>In this course, you will learn:

  <ul>
    <li>to use ideas and concepts from ethics, political philosophy and epistemology to understand and judge contemporary technological phenomena as they relate to self quantification;
    <li>to engage with philosophical papers critically and closely scrutinize their arguments, both orally and in writing;
    <li>to develop a philosophical research question of your own and write a thoroughly argued critique of self-quantification technology.
  </ul>
</p>


<h4>Course structure</h4>
<a name="req">

<p>We will look at one topic each week. While each of the sessions will mainly focus on the specific dimensions raised in the text or texts assigned to that session, they are often intertwined. You must have read all of the texts assigned for each session. All the assigned texts will be available on Canvas or, if they are available as an ebook, a link will be provided on the course schedule page.
</p>

<h5>Reflections and responses (15%)</h5>
<p>This course requires you to read, write, and comment on philosophical ideas. As such, each week you will:
<ul>
  <li>1. read assigned readings; and
  <li>2a. write a short reflection and ask a question; and
  <li>2b. respond to the reflections of other classmates.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Every week, you will write one short critical reflection (around 400 words) on the readings assigned for the week or on a related activity. In addition to your reflection, you will also submit one question every week. The question can be based on your reflection, focus on a different aspect in the reading material or more generally related to the topic of the upcoming session. </p>
<p>Every week, you will also write a brief but polished response (around 200 words) to one of your classmate's reflections, which will be assigned to you. The responses should engage with the core idea or argument advanced in the reflection. They may also offer critical feedback to the writer. Just like discussions in class, all critical feedback should be in good 
faith, courteous, and constructive.</p>

For the reflections and responses you will be assigned to a group, A or B. Every week, members of group A write a reflection on the paper assigned for the Monday session and will respond to the reflections submitted by members of group B for the Wednesday session. Members of group B respond to the reflections submitted by members of group A for the Monday session and will write a reflection for the Wednesday session.

Reflections are due by Sunday, 9pm for group A, and Tuesday 9pm for group B. Responses are due by Monday 9pm for group B, and Wednesday 9pm for group A, unless marked otherwise on the course calendar.

<p>Reflections and responses are graded for completion: you will get full credit for each comment and response as long as they reflect a reasonable attempt to engage with the prompt, assigned texts or your classmates' reflections.</p>

<h5>Discussion leadership (10%)</h5>
Friday sessions usually don't have a paper assigned and are reserved for synthesizing and deepening the discussion of the papers discussed on Monday and Wednesday. Students will help structure and lead those sessions. Concretely, that means that you will co-lead one Friday session together with one or two other students. In order to prepare for leading the discussion, you will be tasked with reading and analyzing a number of reflections and responses your classmates submitted earlier in the week and collecting a set of ideas and questions you would like to see discussed in more detail in the Friday session. Together with your co-discussion leaders, you will take the lead in engaging your classmates in those discussions. 


<h5>Two paper critiques (20%+20%)</h5>
<p>You will write two short critiques of around 1,500 words in which you will closely scrutinize the ideas and arguments of a philosophical paper on self quantification. The first paper you will engage with will be a paper we will have discussed in class. For the second critique, I will choose a paper that’s related to the themes we have covered already, but which we will not discuss extensively in class before you write your critique. We will take time in class to analyze and discuss your critiques after you have submitted them. 
</p>

<h5>Final paper and presentation (25%)</h5>
<p>You will write one long paper of around 3,000 words, on a question of your choice which relates to the topics we have covered throughout the semester.  I will provide feedback on your question, make suggestions to refine it, and finally approve it. You should choose a question that lends itself to a substantive normative argument. It should relate to one or several topics we discussed in class, and I encourage you to look beyond the abstract, technical debates in the literature to search for interesting questions, puzzles, or problems in your everyday life. Questions of applied philosophy are driven by the clashes of ideas, ideals, and values that we encounter in society and the political sphere. In the final paper, I want you to show that you can relate the debates you encounter in this class to a new question, and that you can make a rigorous philosophical argument advocating a position on that question. Early in the semester and throughout the course, we will talk about how to identify philosophical questions as you go through your everyday life and about what makes a good question for a seminar paper. Before you start writing your paper, I strongly encourage you to submit an outline of your key arguments and discuss them with me in office hours. </p>

<p>You will present the key arguments of your paper in class in the final week of the course.  
</p>



<h5>Participation (15%)</h5>
<p>This is a seminar course, so the discussion in class is an essential component. The participation grade is based on two components:
  <ul>
    <li> your presence in class: one unexcused absence is no problem, but beyond that, if you cannot attend class for legitimate personal reasons, or because you feel unwell, please email me in advance;
    <li> overall activity in class discussion: I think of class discussion primarily as a space for learning, which is why I will only grade your overall activity in class discussion, not the quality of your contributions.
  </ul>
  </p>

<p>One note on the culture of debate which I would like to foster in this course: discussions in philosophy are not about winning an intellectual battle, but about engaging with others’ views on their merits. They are also about taking intellectual risks, putting forward a potentially controversial argument, as well as receiving and offering constructive criticism. This is only possible in a class environment in which we build trust. In class, I therefore expect us all to treat each other courteously, engage with each other’s arguments constructively and in good faith no matter the topic.</p>


<h4>Time Commitment</h4>
<a name="req">

<p>You can expect to spend approximately 3 hours per week in class (40 hours total), and around 3-4 hours preparing readings, as well as writing reflections and responses (42-56 hours total). Paper critiques and the final paper will take around 98-126 hours in total throughout the semester.</p>

<p>The course will involve substantial reading for each meeting, and you will need to stay on top of the assigned readings to keep up, as we quickly move between topics. However, the topics we cover week-by-week are relatively standalone, so finding one paper difficult to read will not disadvantage you going forward.</p>

<h4>Policies</h4>
<a name="pol">

<h5>Late Policy</h5>
<p>You can use a budget of three late days in total for the two paper critiques and the final paper. The purpose of these late days is to provide you with some flexibility for unexpected situations in which you find yourself unable to complete an assignment on time (e.g., coinciding deadlines, extracurricular commitments, minor illness, etc.). For those situations, I normally expect you to use your late days, rather than asking for an extension, so make sure to use them judiciously. </p>  

<p> I expect you to attend every session, but let me know if you have any special
requirements. For sickness and other issues of wellbeing, please obtain a Dean's note
and I will accommodate them.</p>

<p>Owing to the small amount of credit that your reflections and responses contribute individually, there will be no late submission for those. If you do encounter particular, unexpected hardships however, please send me an email.</p>

<h5>Accommodations</h5>
<p>Brown University is committed to full inclusion of all students.  Please inform me if you have
a disability or other condition that might require accommodations or modification of any of
these course procedures. You may email me, come to office hours, or speak with me after class,
and your confidentiality is respected. I will do whatever we can to support accommodations
recommended by SEAS. For more information contact Student and Employee Accessibility Services
(SEAS) at 401-863-9588 or SEAS@brown.edu.</p>

<h5>Mental Health</h5>
<p>Being a student can be very stressful. If you feel you are under too much pressure or there are
psychological issues that are keeping you from performing well at Brown, I encourage you to
contact Brown’s Counseling and Psychological Services
(<a href="https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/counseling-and-psychological-services/">CAPS</a>).
They provide confidential counseling and can provide notes supporting extensions on assignments
for health reasons.</p>

<h5>Use of generative AI tools</h5>
<p>Learning how to construct and communicate thoughtful arguments requires both critical (grappling with the ideas presented by others), reflective (coming up and organizing ideas), and writing-related practice. You will only build those skills by spending time on developing, organizing and working through the writing process. You will benefit from this practice even if (and when) you use generative AI tools for other tasks in and beyond this course. Therefore, the use of generative AI tools of any kind (including, but not limited to ChatGPT, Bard, GPT-4, ... ) is  <b>only acceptable in assignments which explicitly permit or call for them to be used.</b> By default, you must assume that the use of these tools for any written work in the course (including weekly reflections and responses, the two paper critiques, and the final project) is <b>not</b> permitted.</p>

<p>If generative AI tools are explicitly permitted to be used for an assignment, and you include material generated by an AI program, you must cite it like any other reference material (having checked its quality -- which may be poor -- just like you would for any other source). You may not submit any work generated by an AI program as your own.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this policy, please talk to me before you start work on an assignment.</p>


<h5>Academic Integrity</h5>
<p>Beyond the provisions of the course policy on the use of generative AI, the Brown academic code applies: “Academic achievement is ordinarily evaluated on the basis of work that a student produces independently. Students who submit academic work that uses others’ ideas, words, research, or images without proper attribution and documentation are in violation of the academic code. Infringement of the academic code entails penalties ranging from reprimand to suspension, dismissal, or expulsion from the University.</p>

<p>“Brown students are expected to tell the truth. Misrepresentations of facts, significant omissions, or falsifications in any connection with the academic process (including change of course permits, the academic transcript, or applications for graduate training or employment) violate the code, and students are penalized accordingly. This policy also applies to Brown alums, insofar as it relates to Brown transcripts and other records of work at Brown.
</p>

<p>“Misunderstanding the code is not an excuse for dishonest work. Students who are unsure about any point of Brown’s academic code should consult their courses instructors or an academic dean, who will be happy to explain the policy.”</p>
